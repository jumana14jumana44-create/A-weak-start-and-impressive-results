# 💻 Complete Sequence of Python Basics Lessons (Phase One)

These lessons form the backbone of any program, and mastering them is essential before moving on to specialized data libraries.

## 1. Input & Output (I/O)

**Completed Lessons:**

- Working with basic data types (String, Integer, Float).
- Print function (`print()`), and input function (`input()`).
- Basic arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).

## 2. Control Flow & Logic

**Lesson 3: Conditionals**
- Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for decision-making in code.
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`).
- Boolean logic (`and`, `or`, `not`).

**Lesson 4: Loops**
- `for` loops for iterating over known sequences.
- `while` loops for conditions.
- Loop control (`break` and `continue`).

## 3. Functions & Organization

**Lesson 5.1 (Almost complete): Definition and Parameters**
- Function definition (`def`).
- Parameters and default arguments.

**Lesson 5.2 (In progress): Return statement**
- The difference between `print` and `return`.
- Storing the returned value in a variable.

## 4. Core Data Structures

**Lesson 6: Lists**
- Creating lists, accessing elements via indexing.
- Basic list operations (`append`, `insert`, `remove`).

**Lesson 7: Dictionaries**
- Working with key-value pairs.
- Adding, modifying, and removing elements.

**Lesson 8: Tuples & Sets**
- Understanding immutable groups (`Tuples`).
- Using sets for storing unique elements.

## 5. Integration & Advanced Application

**Lesson 9: Advanced Flow Control**
- Iteration within data structures (e.g., using `for` to traverse a list).
- Combining conditionals with loops.
- List comprehensions.

**Lesson 10: Basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- Introduction to classes and objects.
- Organizing code into logical units (simplified).

**Lesson 11: File Handling and Errors**
- Reading and writing data to text files.
- Error handling using `try` and `except`.
